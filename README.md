# Credit Card Case Study
---

## Overview
This project analyzes a credit card dataset to identify key insights and build predictive models for improved decision-making. This includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling techniques to address a specific business problem related to credit card usage or customer behavior.

---

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: In-depth analysis of the dataset with visualizations to uncover trends and patterns.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive data cleaning, including encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features.
- **Insights Generation**: Extracting actionable insights to inform business decisions.

## Objectives and Key Questions
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the credit card dataset to enhance understanding and improve decision-making processes. Key questions addressed include:

1. What factors influence customer spending behavior?
2. Are there specific patterns or trends in transaction data?
3. Can we identify high-risk customers based on their transaction history?
4. How do spending patterns vary across different customer segments?
5. Which features are most predictive of a target outcome (e.g., default or high spending)?
